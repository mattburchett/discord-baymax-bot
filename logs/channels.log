[2017-03-23 00:47:35.589] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: "Sir,  do you have a interest in a brand new ADT alarm system?"

This guy sounded indian as fuck
[2017-03-23 00:47:39.283] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: so maybe he forgot that it's 1am.

[2017-03-23 00:48:01.673] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: "Sir, one, it's the middle of the night. Two, I have guns." *click*

[2017-03-23 00:48:14.388] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Well it's not 1 AM over there!
[2017-03-23 00:48:22.553] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: I'm feeling kinda bleh and guilty at the same time.. but idk if I have the right to be.

[2017-03-23 00:48:40.459] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: What's wrong ko?
[2017-03-23 00:49:05.879] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Ryo's parents gave him a car and told him it's his but he constantly has to make sure it's 'okay' to use it and their constant controlling behavior makes it.. difficult to just do what we want, like a normal couple.
[2017-03-23 00:49:14.353] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <charliejay>: how things?
[2017-03-23 00:49:23.090] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: They don't go food shopping so they send him.. on a Friday.. or Saturday.. and because that's when we see eachother, I have to go.
[2017-03-23 00:49:36.636] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Because I'm with him, I'm happy, but also annoyed that they're so incredibly lazy.
[2017-03-23 00:50:20.581] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: However, this situation is a little different: he says he's going to be off tomorrow, but he's supposedly "scared something might happen with the trucks"(?) so he can't drive me in the morning.
[2017-03-23 00:50:23.857] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <bluedinosaursocks>: Oh, alright. How's things for you?
[2017-03-23 00:50:33.562] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: It would've really helped me out because it takes an hour by bus, or 10-15 by car.
[2017-03-23 00:50:41.902] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: And we could've seen eachother and gone out to eat together.
[2017-03-23 00:50:57.851] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: On one hand, I know it's so wrong to expect that he'd just offer to take me and try to make it work..
[2017-03-23 00:51:10.265] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <charliejay>: not bad thanks sorry my typing sucks... still early here
[2017-03-23 00:51:14.148] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: but on the other hand, it would've been so helpful and thoughtful. I feel like I have to drop major hints for him to even consider it.
[2017-03-23 00:51:17.374] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <bluedinosaursocks>: I'm going to sound completely ignorant for a minute.... But what's stopping you guys from moving in together?
[2017-03-23 00:51:21.811] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: I wish I would've learned to drive already.
[2017-03-23 00:51:34.831] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Oh, neither of us are working full-time. He actually just started EMT courses.
[2017-03-23 00:51:46.955] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: I'm graduating this May and will be working full-time hopefully.
[2017-03-23 00:52:02.712] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Then he'll also be working, so.. we're hoping that'll happen soon. Oh, and don't worry, not ignorant at all.
[2017-03-23 00:52:15.675] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <bluedinosaursocks>: It's all good. It's late where I'm at üòÑ
[2017-03-23 00:52:28.880] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <charliejay>: hehe where u at?
[2017-03-23 00:52:48.590] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: He has and is now still working with his father fixing up stores or something, but his father is a cheap jerk who pays him $100 a day, when the tickets they're doing is like $500 a job.. and Ryo doe all of the work.
[2017-03-23 00:53:30.627] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <bluedinosaursocks>: Gotcha. I can see how that'd be frustrating. Also, you've always got the right to feel bleh and guilty. While they're not fun feelings, they are feelings, and you're allowed to have them, even if they might not be completely warranted to every person. That's shitty that he doesn't get paid much for that stuff.... That's not fair at all.
[2017-03-23 00:53:45.143] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Both parents are pure narcs, and make things super difficult between us.
[2017-03-23 00:53:48.470] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <bluedinosaursocks>: Arizona, USA, You?
[2017-03-23 00:53:56.107] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: I guess it just wears me out after a while.
[2017-03-23 00:54:04.234] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: I also struggle with Daryan's controlling mother. And it's a constant irritation.
[2017-03-23 00:54:08.493] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <bluedinosaursocks>: Can also understand that. That's why I'm not in contact with my mom.
[2017-03-23 00:54:15.677] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <charliejay>: i am in Johannesburg south africa
[2017-03-23 00:54:16.189] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: I think it irks me that he's an adult and he doesn't know what he can and can't do.
[2017-03-23 00:54:26.251] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: How do you not know if you can or can not drive me? Why is it their choice?
[2017-03-23 00:54:43.587] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Wake up early and take me, so I don't need to wake up at 7 AM to be at class by 10:30.
[2017-03-23 00:55:07.093] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: It'd be so helpful, and we can see eachother, it's been almost a week now.
[2017-03-23 00:55:14.262] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: I asked Daryan just that question yesterday actually. I asked her if she could spend time with me on (day) if I can get it off for working all these hours. And she said "I don't know if Mom will let me."
[2017-03-23 00:55:20.424] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: She's 18, it's her choice.
[2017-03-23 00:55:33.768] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: My mom is like that too depending on the day.. Sunday is 'her' day with me.
[2017-03-23 00:55:38.706] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: She gets very grumpy if I leave.
[2017-03-23 00:55:49.735] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: With Daryan, it's every day. Because her mother hates me. A lot.
[2017-03-23 00:55:56.485] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: This Sunday is Ryo's birthday so she's still seemingly.. upset about it, but she has no choice.
[2017-03-23 00:56:07.704] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: His parents don't hate me thankfully, they hate eachother seemingly.
[2017-03-23 00:56:11.394] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: And my mom hates everyone.

[2017-03-23 00:56:19.589] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <arielhasfins>: I understand exactly where he's coming from
[2017-03-23 00:57:15.334] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <arielhasfins>: After my accident I was "lent" my family's vehicle. But it's not "fully mine" so I have to ask to use it. And if I ask to do something my parents aren't cool with I.e. Going out and having fun with friends I'm not allowed to go.
[2017-03-23 00:57:21.442] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <bluedinosaursocks>: Nice!
[2017-03-23 00:57:40.821] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <bluedinosaursocks>: And, I guess if you want to put it that way. I think of it more like "team leader".
[2017-03-23 00:57:53.155] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Kim Seok Jin>: gym leader?
[2017-03-23 00:57:54.403] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: I think I'd be less peeved if he tried to at least, ahead of time ask them as he is fully aware that I have classes tomorrow, knows how early I need to get up.. Or straight up said "I wish I could take you tomorrow, but I know I can't and I'm sorry." because then I'd know he's thinking of me.

[2017-03-23 00:58:15.898] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: One of the things I've been really wanting with this house, is for Daryan to move in with me. The first thing she does is talk to her Mom about it, which involves enforcing a *bunch* of conditions before she's *allowed* to move out.
[2017-03-23 00:58:18.212] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: He wasn't told that he was lent it, they said it was "his" but of course, sometimes suddenly ~need it~ to be infront of the house for no reason.
[2017-03-23 00:59:04.928] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: I really just wanted him to offer, for once, and be proactive instead of needing to be the one to drop hints and stuff?
[2017-03-23 00:59:12.690] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <bluedinosaursocks>: No. I don't know the person that started the subreddit, but I know that she's since left the community. I was added on as a mod in the sub almost a year ago... Or maybe just over a year ago. I can't remember.
[2017-03-23 00:59:30.003] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: 1. She must be 21 before she's allowed to move. 
2. We must attend 'couples therapy' for 2 years before moving in together.
3. If we plan to get married, marital counseling comes before that as well. 

Like, sigh...
[2017-03-23 00:59:31.780] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <charliejay>: hehe ok cool!
[2017-03-23 00:59:45.748] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <charliejay>: i only recently found the community
[2017-03-23 01:00:26.025] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Thankfully they're not that uptight, but they've very.. secret narc/crazy.
[2017-03-23 01:00:35.392] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <charliejay>: so i guess modding keeps youu busy
[2017-03-23 01:00:44.624] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: My irritation with it is, her mother has *never* moved out of her mothers house.
[2017-03-23 01:00:45.406] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <bluedinosaursocks>: I know this doesn't help you, but I get where you're coming from. That's what happens with Austin. He doesn't get hints and, while he's sweet as hell, he never initiates and never is the one that's proactive and tries to help. I always think of him as inconsiderate for that reason. He's really sweet most of the time, but he can be dumb and inconsiderate a lot of times when it comes to things that I want. He's just.... oblivious, I guess.
[2017-03-23 01:00:52.247] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: And she wants her kids to do exactly that.
[2017-03-23 01:00:58.374] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Ryo's been afraid of trying new foods because they'll say horrible stuff like "that's nasty" and "you'll get sick" and so he's squeamish.
[2017-03-23 01:01:14.439] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Instead of being good parents and saying "why don't you try it?"
[2017-03-23 01:01:37.524] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: You can't always protect your kids, you have to let them try new things.
[2017-03-23 01:01:39.184] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <bluedinosaursocks>: Very nice. Actually, I'm not too active with modding the subreddit. I basically just take care of stuff here. I work 40+ hours a week though, and can't always attend to the Discord, which is why we have 2 other mods, and 2 new helpers.

[2017-03-23 01:03:43.513] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: I made a bit of a passive aggressive joke and he actually got upset with me.

[2017-03-23 01:05:31.228] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #mod: <bluedinosaursocks>: Okay, so, any reordering of the channels, I apologize for. This trackpad is not as smooth as the one on my Macbook, and I'm still getting used to it (plus, I think it needs to be cleaned), and so I keep accidentally picking up the channels and dropping them in random orders.

Kinda like we feel everyone that isn't from here has one?
[2017-03-23 19:03:48.401] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: Yes
[2017-03-23 19:04:01.853] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Of course, there's different types of accents. I have a mixture between a Missouri accent and a southern accent.

[2017-03-23 19:04:46.297] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Midwesterners don't really have accents.
[2017-03-23 19:04:51.127] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: I think everyone has accents, really
[2017-03-23 19:05:10.801] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: Because we're used to listening to how people speak around us and they're very unique

[2017-03-23 19:08:38.531] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Out of curiousity, do they teach English in school? If so, do they teach you how to *speak* it, as well as write it?

The reason I ask is because my coworker is Russian, and he said they teach you english there, but only how to read/write it.
[2017-03-23 19:08:44.060] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: Oh yes, definitely

[2017-03-23 19:08:49.346] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Something about their accents being too heavy to actually speak it.
[2017-03-23 19:09:00.794] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Cuteboo>: and when he told me he caught it, i asked him what he did with

[2017-03-23 19:09:29.485] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: I'm very strong with English. The reason why they made that so instead of Malay, or Chinese, is to level the playing field amongst the different ethnicities when learning/working
[2017-03-23 19:09:35.805] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Lukara>: Well..

[2017-03-23 19:10:00.862] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: English is the universal language anyway.
[2017-03-23 19:10:35.280] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: My Chinese is just plain fucking awful. It's decent? But I've not really exactly read Chinese in a while, so I'm just terrible at that. I can still speak fluently (I grow up in a Mandarin/Teochew speaking family), but I just can't read advanced Chinese without flipping out for my dictionary *is a failure*

[2017-03-23 19:23:30.895] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Cuteboo>: maybe it was meaningful to me because it was my first relationship after an emotionally abusive one with a dude that would go out of his way to make me cry just because he had fun doing it
[2017-03-23 19:23:37.564] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: Idk, but islamophobia is awful

[2017-03-23 19:25:10.430] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: I don't like it. There's an issue recently in Singapore that blew up because an Islamic religious teacher went to preach about something along the lines of going up in arms and triumphing over Christians and Jews. It's not nice, and someone posted a video of the religious teacher preaching that in the mosque
[2017-03-23 19:25:26.103] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Cuteboo>: IS YOUR ICON FROM THE ROCK COCKS
[2017-03-23 19:25:43.176] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: What made it worse is.... my professor who's teaching Malay studies brought it up to Facebook and said that the people calling for the dismissal of that religious teacher "mindless idiots"

[2017-03-23 19:26:29.485] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: I mean, I don't have many religious believes. I am a Christian. But I haven't been to church in nearly 10 years, my dad kinda killed religion for me.
[2017-03-23 19:26:35.104] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: So essentially, my classes were cancelled, my professor's on suspension, he got hauled in for questioning by the police (talking shit about other religions is actually a crime in Singapore), and now that module's in shambles because none of us know what's going on now

[2017-03-23 19:27:39.685] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: Personally I don't give a shit about religion. I grew up a catholic. I only recently got back into the religion, like went for an Ash Wednesday service, and I've not went back to the church again. I just don't give a shit about other people's beliefs, but when they shit on someone else's beliefs to propagate their own, that's not right at all

[2017-03-23 19:28:24.506] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: I just feel strongly for different things, but religion and race isn't something that I feel strongly for, for me to be up in arms about it
[2017-03-23 19:28:32.372] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: exactly
[2017-03-23 19:28:34.978] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: *come on I shitpost socialist memes on facebook*
[2017-03-23 19:28:38.967] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <LittleWickedQueen>: _pokes <@286333276849831946> and then runs off giggling_
[2017-03-23 19:29:03.231] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: example, i'd rather get up in arms about someone trying to take my guns away than someone complaining about my religion.
[2017-03-23 19:29:10.573] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Like, anti-gun agenda is pushed so hard here.
[2017-03-23 19:29:23.313] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: but what they don't realise is that taking away the guns doesn't remove the crime.
[2017-03-23 19:29:34.153] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Because people who commit crimes, don't have legal guns anyway.
[2017-03-23 19:29:44.626] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <LittleWickedQueen>: I wish I could get past level 18 on this game
[2017-03-23 19:29:46.848] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: I mean, we don't have guns here. Gun legislation is actually pretty strict here
[2017-03-23 19:29:58.996] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: So I grew up not knowing gun privilege, y'know? But yeah
[2017-03-23 19:30:20.104] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Right, but their argument is 'take them away, it'll reduce crime. Lets trust the police!'
[2017-03-23 19:30:27.086] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: I carry a gun because a cop is too heavy.
[2017-03-23 19:30:56.803] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: We do discuss about that issue in classes and all, and I'm naturally pacifist. I just don't think that they're gonna be able to solve the violent crime issue in the US because that's not the root cause you're solving. You're just taking away a means of committing violent crime
[2017-03-23 19:31:27.968] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: I rather you have stricter controls over gun possession than to remove getting guns legally immediately. It just doesn't make sense, and it'll create a larger black market
[2017-03-23 19:31:39.526] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: Just my little opinion on this as a non American
[2017-03-23 19:31:56.135] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: I mean, in Missouri, you're only required to pass a background check...
[2017-03-23 19:32:02.829] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: not even register them, which is fine with me
[2017-03-23 19:32:08.218] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: That's not strict enough lol but yeah
[2017-03-23 19:32:23.103] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: I mean I'm all for strict controls for the betterment of society, less violent crime and all
[2017-03-23 19:32:46.038] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: But who am I to say that this would be a better idea in America? Aka forefront of democracy, free speech and freedom?
[2017-03-23 19:33:02.214] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: Some things can't make sense when we look at the historical and political lenses
[2017-03-23 19:33:15.447] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Right, the right to bear arms is something we promote here. It's in our constitution... some things just shouldn't be taken away.
[2017-03-23 19:33:29.984] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Now, do I feel everyone needs automatic guns? Definitely not, but those are *already* hard to get.
[2017-03-23 19:33:31.582] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <LittleWickedQueen>: _has killed the room_
[2017-03-23 19:33:44.985] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <phr34k5h0w>: i just made dinner

[2017-03-23 19:33:59.789] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: And I think my main irritation is that the news always take gun crimes and shootings as "it was done by an AR-15 assault rifle!"
[2017-03-23 19:34:05.845] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: well, they normally say that before they know anything, for starters.
[2017-03-23 19:34:28.832] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Like the Orlando shooting, wasn't an AR... and Assault Rifles by definition are automatic.
[2017-03-23 19:34:32.717] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: Ah, American news LOL
[2017-03-23 19:34:36.686] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: oh well. It happens
[2017-03-23 19:34:51.968] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: AR-15's are semi-automatic. But that made a huge push to ban AR-15s because 'they're assault rifles'
[2017-03-23 19:35:11.471] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: You can't just pull the trigger on an AR and fire all 30 rounds.
[2017-03-23 19:35:18.164] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: You have to pull that trigger 30 times.
[2017-03-23 19:35:43.089] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: But that makes for a lot more gun drama than there needs to be.

[2017-03-23 19:41:47.478] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Right, I love playing the Devil's advocate of the conversation.
[2017-03-23 19:41:54.611] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: so some of my friends think that i'm a stalin sympathiser because i'm a very huge supporter of what stalin has done *not the violence part, that's dumb and not nice*, but it has changed quite a bit and improved quite a bit from the tsarist rule
[2017-03-23 19:42:25.148] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: but again, in local politics, i'm a huge proponent for the current political party because they're providing and promising things and they're very legitimate (after all, they've been ruling the country since independence, and doing a darn good job of it too)
[2017-03-23 19:42:33.638] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Exactly. You could say the same for Gorbachov  and how between him and Reagan, they ended the cold war. Same argument.
[2017-03-23 19:42:37.630] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: But that was before you were born.
[2017-03-23 19:42:41.591] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: but some of my friends are just following the opposition just because, of well, *duh* they want to be edgy
[2017-03-23 19:42:42.209] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Hell, that was before I wasborn.
[2017-03-23 19:42:43.628] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: and *you*
[2017-03-23 19:42:52.233] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Not *that much* though
[2017-03-23 19:43:28.028] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: The USSR disbanded in 1991 or something like that.
[2017-03-23 19:43:38.991] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Meep>: <:PusheenParty:293182971622457355> i came to school too early üòÑ
[2017-03-23 19:43:43.805] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: yes, 1991
[2017-03-23 19:43:52.666] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: anyway, USSR fucked up really hard eventually, anyway
[2017-03-23 19:43:59.331] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Tharsis>: Oh nos
[2017-03-23 19:44:01.575] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: and gorbachev could have salvaged it, but he did everything *too* quickly
[2017-03-23 19:44:10.975] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Tharsis>: Wait is your icon Jack Frost?
[2017-03-23 19:44:20.234] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <LittleWickedQueen>: Whose?
[2017-03-23 19:44:30.119] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: and everything just fell apart because he gave the people too much power and they overthrew the communist powers. that's okay, but, that wasn't in the game plan gorbachev had in mind
[2017-03-23 19:44:34.112] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Right, but they are better off disbanded imo.
[2017-03-23 19:44:35.505] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: so China really succeeded in that sense
[2017-03-23 19:44:38.512] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Tharsis>: Meep
[2017-03-23 19:44:58.137] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: USSR was just a shitpile eventually, especially at the later end. they needed someone powerful *ahem, like putin*

[2017-03-23 19:46:41.646] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <LittleWickedQueen>: If you click on her name, it shows a profile
[2017-03-23 19:46:48.555] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: and then when it ends, it ends up with us shitposting memes everywhere, on telegram, on text, etc
[2017-03-23 19:46:52.319] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: as long as people respect my opinion. Like, I tried talking them with a friend of mine whos trans, and super super liberal. Oh god, I just put my tail between my legs and ran for the alcohol.
[2017-03-23 19:47:10.720] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: i'm fine with liberal people. as long as they're not shoving *their* opinions down my throat
[2017-03-23 19:47:15.895] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Yeah, she does that.
[2017-03-23 19:47:32.463] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: okay. run for the alcohol
[2017-03-23 19:47:33.506] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Especially the entire trans agenda (and I'm not against trans, I don't care what you do, but... don't force it)
[2017-03-23 19:47:33.769] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: drown in it
[2017-03-23 19:47:38.490] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: yes, ^
[2017-03-23 19:48:05.126] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: but that person being trans is hard, because she's my ex. and now she's FtM... and I, to this day, refuse to call her Nikolas.
[2017-03-23 19:48:09.401] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: i hated my malay studies professor because he was like "i don't give a shit about your gender. if you're biologically male, or biologically female, YOU'RE JUST. THAT."

[2017-03-23 19:48:36.832] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Right, but she's still super feminine, (even though she's on HRT, and has been a couple years), it's her actions that make her feminine, not her look.
[2017-03-23 19:48:38.316] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Lukara>: Hmm, wanna join a discord server but have a fear it'll be dead/inactive and am shy xD
[2017-03-23 19:49:03.810] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Meep>: that's just that, i guess. *don't really give a shit about their actions. do whatever you all feel happy with*

[2017-03-23 19:49:33.144] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: right, i mean, her personality has always been kinda tomboyish, but her emotions and how she gets aggressive is all... female. *shrug*

[2017-03-24 12:15:53.420] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #vent: <SleepyAdmiral>: why dont you think youll find a daddy?
[2017-03-24 12:16:11.148] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: I let Daryan do her own thing though‚Äã. We have a strange relationship though.  I trust that she knows where the limits are and when she has to say something if that happens. I trust her to put the foot down.
[2017-03-24 12:16:14.732] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <ateoz>: When I was a kid our cartoons were in English without subtitles.
[2017-03-24 12:16:15.294] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #vent: <LittleWickedQueen>: Because I know I won't
[2017-03-24 12:16:28.495] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <ateoz>: And I actually learned the language that way :p
[2017-03-24 12:16:42.470] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: And she expects the same from me. And the only time we talk about it, is when we *have* to put the foot down.
[2017-03-24 12:16:58.966] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <ateoz>: Now they dub everything.. This generation won't learn anything.
[2017-03-24 12:17:01.307] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Right, I feel he'd be less upset if he also befriended you!
[2017-03-24 12:17:08.781] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <LittleWickedQueen>: Yeah
[2017-03-24 12:17:20.280] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Like, Daryan knows fully of Em.
[2017-03-24 12:17:34.411] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: She was jealous at first, but trusts me to not let it get out of hand.
[2017-03-24 12:17:43.187] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <ateoz>: So I learned to speak from cartoons and spelling from mmorpgs
[2017-03-24 12:17:43.915] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #vent: <LittleWickedQueen>: It's okay though. I only sometimes want a Daddy. Just when I'm frustrated or lonely. Otherwise I'm okay with being without one.
[2017-03-24 12:18:03.872] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: And we haven't discussed it since. If i have to put my foot down, then it becomes relevant to my relationship with Daryan, then i tell her.
[2017-03-24 12:18:19.423] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <LittleWickedQueen>: _laughs_
[2017-03-24 12:18:20.462] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Yeah, I try to tell Ryo that I would never let something like that happen, but it's not about me apparently? I don't get it entirely, but I'm putting his feelings before mine and doing the right thing.
[2017-03-24 12:18:34.146] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: It would be wrong if I just ignored him, just like you aren't ignoring Daryan.
[2017-03-24 12:18:38.245] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Absolutely you're doing the right thing.
[2017-03-24 12:18:44.740] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <ateoz>: Who needs school anyway.
[2017-03-24 12:18:55.002] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Actually i do kinda ignore her. Not intentionally.
[2017-03-24 12:18:59.204] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Oh my god haha

[2017-03-24 12:19:16.586] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: Oh, absolutely.
[2017-03-24 12:19:30.480] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: But don't ignore her intentionally! You mentioned that she has issues with that, no?
[2017-03-24 12:19:46.617] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: She does. She's clingy though.

[2017-03-24 12:20:48.868] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: She's clingy... I used to be like she is. I'm not anymore.
[2017-03-24 12:20:53.290] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: I got hurt too much.
[2017-03-24 12:21:05.267] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <Nanako>: Which is weird because with other people irl I get kinda annoyed, like "I need my space!! I'm sick of you!" but I don't ever feel that way with hm.

[2017-03-24 13:55:58.503] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <bluedinosaursocks>: Yeah!

[2017-03-24 14:01:43.570] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <bluedinosaursocks>: You know, that's another good reason to have the no soliciting rule up though. Cause had we not had that rule, people could have been posting all their links to icky minor rooms. Then our members could get caught up in that, and then it's not a good situation
[2017-03-24 14:02:00.486] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #vent: <Caduceus>: Banana cream is the best with milk or water, and also in oatmeal with zero sugar.  Tastes delicious.

[2017-03-24 14:02:38.818] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #vent: <Caduceus>: but if you're playing above board, then that's their issue.  Not your flaw.
[2017-03-24 14:02:39.944] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <DecidiousFoot>: probably should have invested in my retirement instead of terrorism.

[2017-03-24 16:05:46.859] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <arielhasfins>: But it's not lit

[2017-03-24 16:06:26.244] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Mesmerale>: That is a very... green... green.

[2017-03-24 16:07:24.793] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Stalast>: That is a very... purple... purple <@191640488644706304>
[2017-03-24 16:07:38.683] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Mesmerale>: Thank you üòÑ
[2017-03-24 16:07:40.397] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Stalast>: I like your choice of colour
[2017-03-24 16:07:41.566] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Mesmerale>: It could be purplier.
[2017-03-24 16:07:51.657] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Mesmerale>: I prefer the more gem-stoney deep vibrant kind.
[2017-03-24 16:08:01.376] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Mesmerale>: But that's very hard to specify and harder to get, so I'm generally happy with any purple.
[2017-03-24 16:08:39.537] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Stalast>: I'm not sure if it's possible to achieve such a colour with just solid colour
[2017-03-24 16:08:47.322] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Mesmerale>: Exactly.
[2017-03-24 16:09:10.162] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Stalast>: But I know what you're looking for. I will just imagine it looks like that
[2017-03-24 16:09:22.833] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <Stalast>: It's the thought that counts
[2017-03-24 16:12:53.912] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <WARBIRD199>: <@191640488644706304>, I can make it purplier, if you had a color code. :)
[2017-03-24 16:13:19.696] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <arielhasfins>: What <@200944723035160576> means is *I* can make it purplier
[2017-03-24 16:13:30.602] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <arielhasfins>: üíú
[2017-03-24 16:13:38.984] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <WARBIRD199>: yes, that is correct.

[2017-03-24 16:14:32.312] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #general: <arielhasfins>: Oh jeez
[2017-03-24 16:16:58.555] [INFO] channels - /r/littlespace: #helpers: <WARBIRD199>: that was the dumbest conference call ever
