# discord-stats-bot

This is basically a personal project of mine in a effort to learn NodeJS and ELK.

I wanted to create a bot for discord that would log it's usage to a centralised logging server. Essentially the bot is just logging usage to files, and logstash-forwarder is passing to ELK.

You need the following modules to use this bot:
 
- discordie
- log4js

```bash
npm install discordie log4js
```
